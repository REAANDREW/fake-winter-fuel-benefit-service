# FAKE Winter Fuel Benefit Service

**This is a system for the purposes of demonstration to explore different patterns and practices which help in the delivery of distributed enterprise applications.** The requirements for the system have been taken from the UK GOV Winter Fuel Benefit eligibility and reward criteria as they are well defined, short and require external system communication among other things.  The main system will be written in **GO**.

## Aspirations

- This project will be comprised of several different systems and each may be of a different programming language including **GO**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Java**, **Rust**, **Scala**.
- Some of the work may include replicating legacy concerns which are present in Government and large organisations today including agent and back-office systems written in **COBOL** and still critical in the day-to-day operations.


## Requirements

The following is taken (as-is) from the GOV.UK site (![https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/overview](https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/overview)) and has been marked up in `markdown` and published below.  These are simply a snapshot in time so the project has SOME requirements to be based on.

#### How and when you’re paid
You’ll get a letter telling you how much you’ll get and an estimated payment date.

Most payments are made automatically between November and December.

If you qualify and you’re not getting a social security benefit (or if you only get Housing Benefit, Council Tax Reduction or Child Benefit), you’ll need to make a claim.

All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid into an account, such as a bank account.

### Eligibility

You’ll qualify for Winter Fuel Payment if:

- you were born on or before 5 May 1953 (for winter 2016 to 2017 - this date changes every year)
- you lived in the UK throughout the week of 19 to 25 September 2016

You may be able to get the payment if you live in Switzerland or a European Economic Area (EEA) country and you have a genuine link with the UK.

You can’t get the payment if you live in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta, Portugal or Spain because the average winter temperature is higher than the warmest region of the UK.

#### When you won’t qualify

You won’t qualify if throughout the week of 19 to 25 September 2016 you:

- were in prison
- were in hospital getting free treatment for more than 52 weeks
- needed permission to enter the UK and didn’t qualify for help from the Department for Work and Pensions
- had lived in a care home for the previous 12 weeks or more and got Pension Credit, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance or income-related Employment and Support Allowance
